## About the Video Course
Do you want to learn how to mix augmented reality with the Internet of Things (IoTAR) in Unity SDK? Do you want to create cutting-edge technology and experience the future of holograms? Or do you want to take your Arduino projects into augmented reality? This is the only course of its kind that will teach you all the fundamentals of augmented reality and the Internet of Things quickly so that you can get started developing your own IoTAR apps.This course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of the Internet of Things and augmented reality using the Vuforia assets in Unity through practical and easy to understand labs. This class covers these capabilities, including getting started, interfacing the Arduino-based Particle Photon IoT microcontroller with the magic of augmented reality. We have designed this course so that you are able to interface any sensor to your IoT device and we show you what we think is the best way to visualize that data so that it makes sense when augmented into the real world.

<H2>What You Will Learn</H2>
<DIV class=book-info-will-learn-text>
<UL>
<LI> You will learn all the fundamentals through practice as you follow along with the training. Together we will build a strong foundation in IoT-AR in Unity SDK with this training for anyone. </LI>
<LI> This course will enable you to:Get started with the Particle Photon Development Kit. Get started in Unity and how to download the Vuforia SDK. </LI>
<LI> Create a simple AR dashboard that interfaces to your Particle Photon. Once you have mastered the basics we go ahead and interface to sensors via IoT and bring them into AR. - See the water level of a plant in AR, almost like having x-ray vision. Dim the intensity of virtual fire with a photo cell. Measure distance in 3-Dimensions with multi-target detection.</LI>
<LI> See through a person's body and see their heart beating in real time augmented reality. Gauge force and gas on a AR meter as well gas emissions.</LI>
<LI> See the weather in augmented reality of almost any city in AR using JSON. Vuforia 7 and Unity 2017.3 Vuforia 7 Ground Plane</LI>

<UL>
<LI> This course is for those who want to learn augmented reality. This course is not for people who are not willing to practice along. You won't learn by watching but rather by implementing the labs provided in this course. Beginners in augmented reality or mixed reality. This course is implemented in Unity on Windows; Android or iOS deployment is not part of the scope of this course. However, you can easily find tutorials on how to export your AR app to mobile operating systems</LI>
